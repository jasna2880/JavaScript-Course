## Lesson 4 – HTML & CSS Review, console.log

Instructions:
Create separate HTML files for each exercise (4a.html, 4b.html, etc.)

## Exercises:

4a. Create a button with the text 'Click' inside.

4b. Create two buttons:
One button with your name
One button with your favorite food

4c. Create a paragraph with the text:
Hello, world!

4d. Continuing from 4c, add another paragraph below it and write something you did today.

4e. Create two buttons:
'Add to cart' and 'Buy now'
Use CSS to give them yellow and orange background colors.

4f. Add the full HTML structure to exercise 4e:
<!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>
(For practice, add the same structure to exercises 4a–4d.)

4g. Continuing from 4f, change the page title to:
Buttons

4h. Continuing from 4g, add a <script> element so that when the page loads,
the message 'Welcome!' is displayed in the Console using console.log().

## Challenge Exercises:

Setup:
Create a new file named 4i.html for exercises 4i and 4j.

4i. Using HTML and CSS, copy the following design:

Adults Plain Cotton T-shirt  
Price: $7.99  

Add to cart  
Buy now  

(Make sure to follow proper HTML structure.)

4j. Continuing from 4i, add onclick attributes to both buttons:

- When clicking 'Add to cart', show a popup with the text 'Added'.
- When clicking 'Buy now', first display 'Loading...' in the Console,
  then show a popup with the text 'Purchased'.
