## Lesson 3 – Strings (JavaScript)

Instructions:
Do all exercises in the Browser Console (Right click → Inspect → Console)

## Exercises:

3a. Create the text 'My name is: ' as a string.

3b. Create your name as a string.
Example: 'Jasna'

3c. Using concatenation, add the strings from 3a and 3b to display:
My name is: Jasna

3d. At a restaurant, you order 1 coffee ($5) and 1 bagel ($3).
Using math and concatenation, display:
Total cost: $8

3e. Do the same as 3d, but use a template string and interpolation.

3f. Display the result from 3e using alert().

3g. You order 1 coffee ($5.99) and 1 bagel ($2.95).
Calculate the total cost in cents to avoid inaccuracies and display:
Total cost: $8.94

3h. Do the same as 3g, but use a template string and interpolation.

3i. Display the result from 3h using alert().

3j. Using a multi-line string, display the following in a popup:

Total cost: $8.94
Thank you, come again!

## Challenge Exercises:

Setup:
Update the Amazon cart to:
2 basketballs ($20.95 each)
2 t-shirts ($7.99 each)
Shipping & handling: $9.98

3k. Using interpolation, create:

3l. Create:
Shipping & handling: $9.98

3m. Create:
Total before tax: $67.86

3n. Create:
Estimated tax (10%): $6.79
(use Math.round())

Finish:
Reset the cart to 1 basketball and 1 t-shirt (free shipping).
